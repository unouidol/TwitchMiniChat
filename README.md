> **What is it?**

Twitch Chat + Pokemon Community Game (PCG) extension integration supporting multi account in parallel!
V2.1.0 18/1/2026

V2.1.0 update! Chat history is now available for all channels! Just type in the channel name you want to log-in in the main page.

> **What to download**

TMC-arm64-v8a-release.apk is for newer smartphone. If it fails to install try TMC-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
The apk are a bit "overweight" because the library required for it to open PCG extension is rather big.

> **How to install**

you have to download the apk (https://github.com/unouidol/TwitchMiniChat_v2/releases/tag/v2.1.0), then you need to allow android to install apk outside the PlayStore i.e. "Install unknown apps"
Settings > Apps > Special access or Security.

Locate the downloaded apk in the mobile device dowload folder and tap it.

> **How to use**

In the log in page you can specify the channel you wish to chat in, then you press twitch log in and this will prompt an autentication page directly from twitch.

Once the initial log in is done, you can then press the "start PCG" button. This will prompt another twitch log in page. 

Why the double log in? Because the first one serves to grant acces to the IRC chat channel, while the second allows to authenticate yourself into the PCG extension.
