> **What is it?**

Twitch Chat + Pokemon Community Game (PCG) extension integration supporting multi account in parallel!
V2.2.0 28/1/2026
The app is designed to help the efficient management of multiple PCG accounts for mobile users.

V2.2.0 update! You can navigate channels directly from the chat page, just type the channel name in the top search bar. A log of the recent searched channel is available as a dropdown list when typing in the search bar, if you want to delete an entry, just press the "x" next to it. 
The refresh button allows to refresh chat manually if needed.
Impoved chat message deduplication logic, no more "invisible" messages!

> **What to download**

TMCx.x.0-arm64-v8a-release.apk is for newer smartphones. If it fails to install try TMCx.x.0-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
The apk are a bit "overweight" because the library required for it to open PCG extension is rather big.

> **How to install**

You have to download the apk, then you need to allow android to install apk outside the PlayStore i.e. "Install unknown apps"
Settings > Apps > Special access or Security.

Locate the downloaded apk in the mobile device dowload folder and tap it.

> **How to use**

In the log in page you can specify the channel you wish to chat in, then you press twitch log in and this will prompt an autentication page directly from twitch.

Once the initial log in is done, you can then press the "start PCG" button. This will prompt another twitch log in page. 

Why the double log in? Because the first one serves to grant acces to the IRC chat channel, while the second allows to authenticate yourself into the PCG extension.

> **Curious about the Code**
If you want you can check the source code in the dev branch of this repository :)
