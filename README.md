Twitch Chat + PCG extension integration supporting multi account in parallel!

As of now, chat history is available only on my twitch channel (unouidol) but the possibility of having it for different channels is under implementation.

note: you have to download the apk, then you need to allow android to install apk outside the PlayStore i.e. "Install unknown apps"

Settings > Apps > Special access or Security.
